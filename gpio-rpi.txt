Raspberry Pi 3 Tutorial: Connecting Breadboard and LEDs
by brianguy 

Published on Jun 19, 2016
This video demonstrates how to attach a breadboard to a Raspberry Pi 3 with optional touchscreen. LED lights are then installed on the 
breadboard and turned on/off via the WiringPi software.

Hardware tips:
* Disconnect power to your Raspberry Pi before attempting this tutorial.
* Do not connect LEDs directly to the breadboard rows that are already in use by the T cobbler. Use the lower rows that are free.
* The positive pin (longer leg) of the LED connects in the same numbered row (different letter) as the jumper wire.
* The negative pin (shorter leg) of the LED connects in the same numbered row (different letter) as one end of the resistor.
* The other end of the resistor connects in the negative column on the edge of the breadboard (any row).
* The other end of the jumper wire connects in the same row (any lettered column) as the desired GPIO pin as indicated on the T cobbler.

Example pins:
Connect LED 1 positive leg to breadboard row 30, column E
Connect LED 1 negative leg to breadboard row 29, column E
Connect LED 2 positive leg to breadboard row 28, column E
Connect LED 2 negative leg to breadboard row 27, column E
Connect LED 3 positive leg to breadboard row 26, column E
Connect LED 3 negative leg to breadboard row 25, column E
Connect Resistor 1 leg 1 to breadboard row 29, column C
Connect Resistor 1 leg 2 to breadboard 3V negative column, any unused row
Connect Resistor 2 leg 1 to breadboard row 27, column C
Connect Resistor 2 leg 2 to breadboard 3V negative column, any unused row
Connect Resistor 3 leg 1 to breadboard row 25, column C
Connect Resistor 3 leg 2 to breadboard 3V negative column, any unused row
Connect Jumper 1 end 1 to breadboard row 30, column A
Connect Jumper 1 end 2 to the breadboard row that aligns with GPIO 17 (pin 11) on the T cobbler, column C
Connect Jumper 2 end 1 to breadboard row 28, column A
Connect Jumper 1 end 2 to the breadboard row that aligns with GPIO 27 (pin 13) on the T cobbler, column C
Connect Jumper 3 end 1 to breadboard row 26, column A
Connect Jumper 1 end 2 to the breadboard row that aligns with GPIO 22 (pin 15) on the T cobbler, column C

To install WiringPi, follow the instructions at http://wiringpi.com/download-and-inst...

To change the orientation of the Raspberry Pi Touchscreen and to flip it upside down, add the following line to /boot/config.txt:

lcd_rotate=2

The commands to control the LEDs are as follows.

To set the pins to Output mode:
gpio -g mode 17 out
gpio -g mode 27 out
gpio -g mode 22 out

To turn the LEDs on:
gpio -g write 17 1
gpio -g write 27 1
gpio -g write 22 1

To turn the LEDs off:
gpio -g write 17 0
gpio -g write 27 0
gpio -g write 22 0

Note: the ending 2 in the “gpio -g write 22 2” command in the video is a typo.
